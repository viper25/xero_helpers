As of GB Date if they have dues of > 6 months they are not eligible

Get Members that are eligible for GB. Letâ€™s say annual subscription is $600 and if the member has paid $300 which is equal to 6 months. 
So in Sept his dues are from July to September which is less than 6 months and hence the member is eligible. 

The invoices are checked to see if they were modified at the begining of this year (as they should be when creating new invoices 
after Jan 1). If this check is not there, we will get all invoices from years past.
