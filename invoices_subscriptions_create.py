‚ñ∂ Create New invoices - for Annual Subscription based on prevoius years invoice amount
‚ñ∂ Input file is a text file of Member Codes. It's good (not mandatory that the list be sorted) Format:
    R023
    Z001
  You can also use `generate_Xero_Contact_List.py` to generate the csv file of the format:
    R023,Reji K Varghese,208dd022-9620-4aef-b515-f00b726bd1a8
  The code will handle both types of files.
‚ñ∂ Set the NEXT invoice in Xero (https://go.xero.com/InvoiceSettings/InvoiceSettings.aspx) to HF-22-0001
‚ñ∂ Account Code 3010 to exist (Member Subscription)
‚ñ∂ Check Tenant IDs in mysecrets.py. If using Demo Tenant, get it's TenantID using xero_first_time.py
‚ñ∂ ‚ùó We assume the subscription amount is the same as last year. Override manually if not so!
